# HEAT-UI
In this `README` you will find step by step instructions to get up and running developing **heat-ui** applications.
Heat-ui framework is a complete end to end development setup. 

In heat-ui you find:

1. Visual Studio Code configuration and setup
2. TypeScript configuration for Visual Studio Code
3. Full code completion for all Angular, Angular Material and all our own code
4. Gulp development and build setup
5. Gulp TypeScript configurations
6. Local development server TypeScript bindings
7. TypeScript client side services
  1. cryptography
  2. networking, real-time push pull and pubsub
  3. byte/binary support (object mappers)
  4. user/key management
  5. settings framework (with ui bindings)
  6. create, inspect or veryfy HEAT Ledger transactions
8. UI components
  1. real-time update on web socket events
  2. dialog support (standard, input, multi page wizard)
  3. auto complete support (see server results as you type)
9. Angular Material and the Google Material Design rules
10. Coded in Angular 2 style
11. Bootstrapper that injects Angular 2 compatible `Component`, `Service`, `Inject` (and others) TypeScript decorators.
12. High compatibility with Angular 2 through our very own Angular 1 to Angular 2 bridge

## Installation

To get started developing heat-ui applications you really need your own copy of heat-ui. Easiest is to simply git clone the repo. This way you have everything in place to share back changes you made to heat-ui and to easily download upstream changes to heat-ui to your local development copy.

To clone heat-ui to your own machine open a terminal and `cd` to where you want your heat-ui folder to appear. Now type the following to clone heat-ui.

`git clone https://github.com/Heat-Ledger-Ltd/heat-ui.git`

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a Microsoft Open Source project that provides you with a cross platform (Windows, Linux, Mac) free advanced development suite. It offers a file explorer, debugging support, git integration and excellent support for the Open Source Microsoft TypeScript language.

One of the main reasons why creating applications with heat-ui goes so fast is because of the powerfull tooling provided by Visual Studio Code and it's of TypeScript. Unlike any other Javascript application you've made before, through VS Code we get the same productivity boost one finds when using an IDE for Java, C++, C# or any other strongly typed language.

Please go ahead to https://code.visualstudio.com and install the latest version for your platform.
